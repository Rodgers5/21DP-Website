        <h4><b>WHY  21ST DEAF PROGRAMME?</b></h4>

  <p>
	  21DP was founded to focus on the welfare of the deaf individuals within the society, with the aim of lifting them up and creating opportunities for them. It all started with the good spirit of the deaf individual to help other deaf individuals who are unable to get opportunities in the economic and business world and make it a better place for them to live.
     
We are in the 21st CENTURY, in the year 2021, and the decision to make the group official 21DP was made on 21st day of the month, hence our Organizationâ€™s name.
 
 21DP is governed by the deaf individuals who have the ability to lead, understand and are all honest, trustworthy, loyal and faithful individuals.
Our goal is to make it easy for the deaf individuals to live a better life free from stress and worries caused by brokenness and unemployment among many of them.
